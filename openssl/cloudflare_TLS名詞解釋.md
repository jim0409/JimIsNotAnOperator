# TLS Glossary
1. Session Key
> This is the end result of a handshake. It's a key for a symmetric cipher, and allows the client and server to encrypt messages to each other

2. Client random
> This is a sequence of 32 bytes created by the client.
It's unique for each connection, and is supposed to contain a four-byte timestamp followed by 28 random bytes.

Recently, Google Chrome switched to using 32 bytes of random in order to prevent client fingerprinting. These random values are often called a `nonce`

3. Server random
> A server random is the same as the client random except generated by the server.

4. Pre-main secret
> This is a 48-byte blob of data. It can be combined with both the client random and the server random to create the session key using a `pseudorandom function(PRF)`

5. Cipher suite
> This is a unique identifier for combining algorithms making up a TLS connection. It defines one algorithm for each of the following
```md
1. key establishment(typically a Diffie-Hellman variant or RSA)
2. authentication(the certificate type)
3. confidentiality(a symmetric cipher)
4. integrity(a has function)

## For example `AES128-SHA` defines a session that uses:
- RSA for key establishment(implied)
- RSA for authentication(implied)
- 128-bit `Advanced Encryption Standard` in `Cipher Block Chaining(CBC) mode` for confidentiality
- 160-bit `Secure Hashing Algorithm(SHA)` for integrity

> A more dauting, but valid cipher suite is `ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384` which defines a session that uses:

- Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephermeral(ECDHE) key exchange for key establishment
- Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithms(ECDSA) for authentication
- 256-bit `Advanced Encryption Standard` in `Galois/Counter mode(GCM)` for confidentiality
- 384-bit `Secure Hashing Algorithm` for integrity

```
With these definitions in hand, Lets walk through an RSA handshake.
